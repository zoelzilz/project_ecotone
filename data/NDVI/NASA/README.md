## 3. Area Sample Extraction Process  

When an area sample extraction request is successfully submitted, AppEEARS
implements a series of tools and services to extract the exact data the user is
interested in; or rather, extracts data from specific data layers that
intersect with the input vector file's features. AppEEARS first uploads the
input vector file and reprojects it to the source projection of the data layer
of interest. The PROJ.4 definitions for each data collection available through
AppEEARS are listed below.  

### MODIS (TERRA, AQUA, & Combined)

### ASTER GDEM v3 and Global Water Bodies Database v1  

    "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs=True"  

### NASADEM v1 (30m)  

    "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs=True"

    "+proj=utm  +zone=XX +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs=True"

Where "XX" = UTM zone number.  

Example:  

    "+proj=utm  +zone=13 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs=True"

### GEOLST4KHR v002

    "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs=True"

Following the reprojection of the vector file, a bounding box for each feature in the vector file is determined. Each corner point is first determined using the minimum and maximum latitude and longitude values. An additional 1 pixel buffer is applied to each corner point to create the feature bounding box. See below for details on how the bounding box is determined.  

### Landsat C2 ARD

Landsat C2 ARD has 3 projections, one for the conterminous United States (CONUS), one for Alaska, and one for Hawaii.

CONUS:

    "+proj=aea +lat_1=55 +lat_2=65 +lat_0=50 +lon_0=-154 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs=True"

Alaska:

    "+proj=aea +lat_0=50 +lon_0=-154 +lat_1=55 +lat_2=65 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs=True"

Hawaii:

    "+proj=aea +lat_0=3 +lon_0=-157 +lat_1=8 +lat_2=18 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs=True"

### US NPS Water Balance

    "+proj=lcc +lat_1=25 +lat_2=60 +lat_0=42.5 +lon_0=-100 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs=True"

### EMIT L1B Radiance and L2A Reflectance

EMIT L1B and L2A products can be requested in spatially raw, non-orthorectified format with an accompanying geometric lookup table, or already orthorectified.

    "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs=True"

#### Feature Bounding Box Calculation  

- `UpperLeft   =   (maxLat + cellSize), (minLon - cellSize)`  
- `LowerLeft   =   (minLat - cellSize), (minLon - cellSize)`  
- `UpperRight  =   (maxLat + cellSize), (maxLon + cellSize)`  
- `LowerRight  =   (minLat - cellSize), (maxLon + cellSize)`  

For each feature, a series of tools and services are used to determine which spatial tiles intersect with the coordinates of the feature bounding box for the data layer of interest. These tiles are extracted (from OPeNDAP) to a server-side work environment where they are mosaicked into an image. Tile extraction and processing is implemented for each requested composite period (e.g., daily, weekly, 8-day, 16-day, monthly, seasonal, or annual) to create a time series image stack. If the user chooses to have the output projection for each extracted data file match, then the image stack is reprojected into the user-requested projection using the PROJ.4 definition described above. The image stacks are finally clipped to the input feature shape to only maintain the data intersecting the feature shape. Data outside of the feature shape are converted to a product-specific NODATA value. Each clipped image in the time series image stack is saved as a CF-compliant NetCDF file or in a series of Geospatial Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF) files with a unique name following the naming conventions described in Section 4 of this README.

AppEEARS implements a strict procedure for reprojecting data outputs. Pixel size and resampling methods are non-customizable in AppEEARS. Reprojected data are produced using the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) gdalwarp function in combination with the PROJ.4 string definition for the user-defined output projection type. Reprojection is performed using nearest neighbor resampling. If the projection units are the same between the native and output projections, the native pixel size is used to reproject the image. If the projection units between the native and output projections are different (e.g. sinusoidal (m) to geographic (degrees), pixel size is calculated by reprojecting the center pixel of the original image, calculating its width and height, and then squaring all pixels). The latitude and longitude of the region of interest are maintained in the conversion.

**NOTE:**  

- Requested date ranges may not match the reference date for multi-day products. AppEEARS takes an inclusive approach when extracting data for sample requests, often returning data that extends beyond the requested date range. This approach ensures that the returned data includes records for the entire requested date range.  
- If selected, the SRTM v3, ASTER GDEM v3 and Global Water Bodies Database v1, and NASADEM v1 products will be extracted regardless of the time period specified in AppEEARS because they are static datasets. The date field in the data tables reflect the nominal date for each of these products.  
- If the visualizations indicate that there are no data to display, proceed to checking the .csv output file. Data products that have both categorical and continuous data values (e.g. MOD15A2H) are not able to be displayed in the visualizations within AppEEARS.  

## 4. Area Sample Naming Convention  

Output data files returned by AppEEARS have the following naming convention:  

`<ProductShortName>.<Version>_<LayerName>_doy<Year><JulianDate>_<AppEEARSFeatureID>.<FileFormat>`  

### Example output file name (.tif)  

    MOD13Q1.061__250m_16_days_NDVI_doy2005193.aid0002.tif  

**where:**  

    <ProductShortName> .......... MOD13Q1  
    <Version> ................... 061  
    <LayerName> ................. _250m_16_days_NDVI  
    <Year> ...................... 2005  
    <JulianDate> ................ 193  
    <AppEEARSFeatureID> ......... aid0002  
    <FileFormat> ................ tif

The AppEEARS Feature ID is assigned automatically by the system.  

## 5. Data Quality  

When available, AppEEARS extracts and returns quality assurance (QA) data for each data file returned regardless of whether the user requests it. This is done to ensure that the user possesses the information needed to determine the usability and usefulness of the data they get from AppEEARS. Most data products available through AppEEARS have an associated QA data layer. Some products have more than one QA data layer to consult. See below for more information regarding data collections/products and their associated QA data layers.  

### 5.1. MODIS (Terra, Aqua, & Combined)  

All MODIS land products, as well as the MODIS Snow Cover Daily product, include quality assurance (QA) information designed to help users understand and make best use of the data that comprise each product.  

- See the MODIS Land Products QA Tutorials: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/resources/e-learning/> for more QA information regarding each MODIS land product suite.
- See the MODIS Snow Cover Daily product user guide for information regarding QA utilization and interpretation.

### 5.2. NASA MEaSUREs SRTM v3 (30m & 90m)  

SRTM v3 products are accompanied by an ancillary "NUM" file in place of the QA/QC files. The "NUM" files indicate the source of each SRTM pixel, as well as the number of input data scenes used to generate the SRTM v3 data for that pixel.  

- See the user guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/179/SRTM_User_Guide_V3.pdf> for additional information regarding the SRTM "NUM" file.

### 5.3. GPW v4.11  

The GPW `Population Count`, `Population Density`, and `Basic Demographic Characteristics` data layers are accompanied by `Data Quality Indicators` datasets. The `Data Quality Indicators` were created to provide context for the population count and density grids, and to provide explicit information on the spatial precision of the input boundary data. The data context grid (data-context1) explains pixels with "0" population estimate in the population count and density grids, based on information included in the census documents. The mean administrative unit area grid (mean-admin-area2) measures the mean input unit size in square kilometers. It provides a quantitative surface that indicates the size of the input unit(s) from which the population count and density grids were created.  

### 5.4. NASA VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) & NOAA-20)  

All NASA VIIRS land products include quality information designed to help users understand and make best use of the data that comprise each product. For product-specific information, see the link to the NASA VIIRS products table provided in section 6.  

**NOTE:**  

- The version 1 Suomi NPP NASA VIIRS Surface Reflectance data products VNP09A1 and VNP09H1 contain two quality layers: `SurfReflect_State` and `SurfReflect_QC`. Both quality layers are provided to the user with the request results. Due to changes implemented on August 21, 2017 for forward processed data, there are differences in values for the `SurfReflect_QC` layer in VNP09A1 and `SurfReflect_QC_500m` in VNP09H1.  
- Refer to the version 1 Suomi NPP NASA VIIRS Surface Reflectance User's Guide Version 1.1: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/123/VNP09_User_Guide_V1.1.pdf> for information on how to decode the `SurfReflect_QC` quality layer for data processed before August 21, 2017. For data processed on or after August 21, 2017, refer to the Suomi NPP NASA VIIRS Surface Reflectance User's guide Version 1.6: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/124/VNP09_User_Guide_V1.6.pdf>.  

### 5.5. SMAP  

SMAP products provide multiple means to assess quality. Each data product contains bit flags, uncertainty measures, and file-level metadata that provide quality information. Results downloaded from AppEEARS and/or data directly requested via middleware services contain not only the requested pixel/data values, but also the decoded bit flag information associated with each pixel/data value extracted. For additional information regarding the specific bit flags, uncertainty measures, and file-level metadata contained in this product, refer to the Quality Assessment section of the user guide for the specific SMAP data product in your request: <https://nsidc.org/data/smap/smap-data.html>.

### 5.13. EMIT L1B Radiance and L2A Reflectance

EMIT L1B At-Sensor Calibrated Radiance and Geolocation Data 60m (EMITL1BRAD) collection does not include quality information. EMIT L2A Estimated Surface Reflectance and Uncertainty and Masks 60m (EMITL2ARFL) collection does not have a direct quality assessment, but the Reflectance Uncertainty product (EMIT_L2A_RFLUNCERT) contains uncertainty estimates about the reflectance captured as per-pixel, per-band posterior standard deviations, and the EMIT L2A Mask (EMIT_L2A_Mask) contains atmospheric state estimates and binary flags that can be used for quality filtering. More details about the EMIT_L2A_Mask can be found in the EMITL2ARFL User Guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1569/EMITL2ARFL_User_Guide_v1.pdf>

## 6. Data Caveats  

### 6.1.1. ECOSTRESS Swath V1 and V2  

- ECOSTRESS Swath data products are natively stored in swath format. To fulfill AppEEARS requests for ECOSTRESS Swath products, the data are first resampled from the native swath format to a georeferenced output. This requires the use of the requested ECOSTRESS product files and the corresponding ECO1BGEO: <https://doi.org/10.5067/ECOSTRESS/ECO1BGEO.001> files for all ECOSTRESS Swath products. To do this conversion, an index array and distance array are created, then the nearest area pixel is located. Next, the Euclidean distance to that area pixel plus all surrounding pixels is measured within a 210 meter search radius (+/- a 3 pixels). This results in 49 pixels measured for every swath pixel. If the distance measured is less than what's currently present in any distance array, then the new distance as well as the swath index value are recorded into the index array used to convert to an area output.  

### 6.1.2. ECOSTRESS Tiled V2  

- ECOSTRESS Tiled data products are stored as cloud optimized geotiffs tiled based on the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) to standardize data for ease of use in time-series analyses. The tiles are delivered in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. More detail can be found in the User Guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/423/ECO2_User_Guide_V2.pdf>.  
- Multiple ECOSTRESS v2 Tiled granules can exist per day for the same tile as a result of the ISS orbit. Since variables like surface temperature are highly time-dependent, tiles are only merged if they fall within the same UTM zone and have the same timestamp (both tiles are from the same orbit and scene). Merging is done using the `merge` function from the `rasterio` Python package. Please note, there are overlap in ECOSTRESS Source Tiled data and pixels do not align. Therefore, relatively slight pixel shift is expected in AppEEARS outputs. 
- It is not uncommon for many pixels returned to contain NaN values. If any layer requested or the QC layer contains valid data, the remaining requested layers will be returned even if only NaN values are present.  

### 6.2. Suomi NPP VIIRS Land Surface Phenology Product Version 1 (VNP22Q2.001)  

- A subset of the science datasets/variables for VNP22Q2.001 are returned in their raw, unscaled form. That is, these variables are returned without having their scale factor and offset applied. AppEEARS visualizations and output summary files are derived using the raw data value, and consequently do not characterize the intended information ("day of year") for the impacted variables. The variables returned in this state include:  

    1. Date_Mid_Greenup_Phase (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  
    2. Date_Mid_Senescence_Phase (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  
    3. Onset_Greenness_Increase (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  
    4. Onset_Greenness_Decrease (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  
    5. Onset_Greenness_Maximum (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  
    6. Onset_Greenness_Minimum (Cycle 1 and Cycle 2)  

- To convert the raw data to "day of year" (doy) for the above variables, use the following equation:  

      doy = Raw_Data_Value * 1 – (Given_Year - 2000) * 366

### 6.3 SMAP

#### 6.3.1. SMAP Enhanced L3 Radiometer Global and Polar Grid Daily 9 km EASE-Grid Soil Moisture (SPL3SMP_E)

- The SPL3SMP_E includes additional layers for AM and PM north-polar grid soil moisture retrievals. These additional layers are not supported in AppEEARS.

#### 6.3.2. SMAP L4 Global 3-hourly 9 km EASE-Grid Surface and Root Zone Soil Moisture Geophysical Data (SPL4SMGP)

- The SPL4SMGP provides 3-hourly data within a single day. AppEEARS specify the observation date (`YYYYDOY`) in the file name but the time information is represented by an index. The observations occurred at 01:30, 04:30, 07:30, 10:30, 13:30, 16:30, 19:30, 22:30 on the same day are separated by _0, _1, _2, _3, _4, _5, _6, _7 indices respectively. For instance, `_2` in `SPL4SMGP.007_Geophysical_Data_surface_temp_2_doy2024031_aid0001.tif` shows this data is captured at 07:30 am on Jan 31st, 2024.

### 6.4. HLS v2.0  

- HLS has adopted a gridded tiling system based on the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) to standardize data for ease of use in time-series analyses. The tiles are delivered in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. More detail can be found in the User Guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1326/HLS_User_Guide_V2.pdf>.
- Scenes are merged using the `merge` function from the `rasterio` Python package if they fall within the same UTM zone.  
- When requesting HLS timeseries, note that Sentinel-2 launched after Landsat was already active. Landsat OLI (HLSL30 v002) products are available from 2013-04-11 to present, while Sentinel-2 MSI products (HLSS30 v002) are available from  2015-11-30 to present.  
- Extra granules from outside the region of interest specified may appear in the granule list if the region of interest is close to an area where MGRS tiles overlap.  

### 6.5. GPW v4.11

- AppEEARS only provides access to GPW v4.11 Basic Demographic Characteristics estimates of population counts by age and sex for the year 2010. Estimates of population density by age and sex are not returned.  

### 6.6. GEOLST4KHR v002

- The NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) GEOLST4KHR version 2 data product are natively stored in swath format. Similar to ECOSTRESS Swath data, GEOLST4KHR data are first resampled from the native swath format to a georectified output. This nearest-neighbor resampling process will result in accuracy lost. To do this conversion, an index array and distance array are created, then the nearest area pixel is located. Next, the spherical distance to that area pixel plus all surrounding pixels is measured within a 12 kilometer search radius (+/- 3 to 21 pixels). The pixel search radius is dynamic based on current swath observation latitude. If the distance measured is less than what's currently present in any distance array, then the new distance as well as the swath index value are recorded into the index array used to convert to an area output.

- GEOLST4KHR version 2 data product does not have any associated quality layer.

### 6.7. MOD44B V6.1

- Value zero in the Cloud and Quality layers from MOD44B Version 6.1 Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) yearly product is assigned to Fill Value in the source file while value zero is meaningful for those layers. If comparing Cloud and Quality layers outputs with source files, users may notice that within the source files zero is assigned to fill value, however zero is within the valid range. Thus, AppEEARS outputs Use -999 as a fill value for those layers.

### 6.8. EMIT L1B Radiance and L2A Reflectance

- The EMIT mission is focused on collecting data from land arid dust source regions, meaning that coverage is limited to those regions based upon a mask. You can explore coverage and forecasted coverage using Jet Propulsion Laboratory's [Visions: EMIT Open Data Portal](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/data/data-portal/coverage-and-forecasts/)
- Both EMIT L1B Radiance and L2A Reflectance collections are natively provided in spatially raw, non-orthorectified format, but have an included geometry lookup table (GLT). The GLT is two-layered orthorectified (EPSG:4326) grid in the 'location' group of the NetCDF4 file that contains cross-track and down-track pixel indices that can be used to quickly and consistently orthorectify the radiance or reflectance products.
- EMIT area outputs are not mosaicked, each scene is subset to the specified region(s) and users can make the decision whether mosaicking adjacent scenes is appropriate.
- There are several output choices for EMIT area outputs. They can be requested as either netCDF4 format, or ENVI binary format with a header. Additionally, users may request area samples that are orthorectified or spatially raw (non-orthorectified) with a GLT.
- Elevation data is always included in requests. For API users there is an additional 'elev' layer listed, but that layer cannot be requested. This has to be present due to some constraints of AppEEARS' backend.
