## Planned Initial Analyses
- response variable: animal activity (count of occurrences) across all species and across entire study with month as random effect
- effect variables of interest: distance from Jalama, human activity, species
      - maybe above or below Point Conception (barrier to human movement from Jalama)
- random variables: month
- will need to include an offset of days active per site
 
## Bin Data Appropriately
counts by site > month (losing daily or weekly variation or variation due to species)
counts by 24hr period, results in zero inflation, but that might be ok

## We're going to change gears and use some ready-made packages to understand activity levels

### Specifically the 'activity' package
```{r playing with activity}
require(activity)

### following this guide: https://bookdown.org/c_w_beirne/wildCo-Data-Analysis/activity.html
